【~ Installation ~】

The examples are using the "magic8" name, but you can pick any name you want, or just rename it yourself if you want, your choice


1. Copy the script to one of the names you like:
```
cp magic8 ~/Downloads/magic8
```

2. Move it to /usr/bin so it can be run globally:
```
sudo mv ~/Downloads/magic8 /usr/bin/magic8
```

3. Repeat if you'd like to install it under other names!
