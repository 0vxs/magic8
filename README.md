# magic8
This is the Magic8 Command for Linux! This command has no importance, it's just for fun.



Installation:

Move the name(s) that you prefer into /usr/bin

That's it, then you just use the preferred command!




All names I made up for this command:
magic8 8ball magic8ball mono8 mono8ball monoball
